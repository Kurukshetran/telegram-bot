= Let's Encrypt

Add ssl certificate to your domain.

== For Fritz!Box AVM Router

AVM is currently working on a setting for Let's Encrypt and their routers.

See https://avm.de/fritz-labor/fritz-labor-fuer-fritzbox-7490-und-7590/lets-encrypt/

== Using certbot

[source, console]
----
cd {your home directory}

mkdir certbot

cd certbot

wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto

chmod +x certbot-auto

./certbot-auto certonly -a standalone -d {your domain name -> example.ddns.net}

cd /etc/letsencrypt/live/{your domain name -> example.ddns.net}/

openssl pkcs12 -export -in fullchain.pem -inkey privkey.pem -out keystore.p12 -name tomcat -CAfile chain.pem -caname root

----

The _keystore.p12_ has to be moved to a location, which can be accessed by the user, which starts the spring boot app service. The `chown -R {username} and chgrp -R {username} command are helpful here.

See _server.ssl.key-store_ property in _application.properties_ file.
